	  	<h3>About Us</h3>
		<h5>A NEW WAY OF THINKING</h5> 
		<p>It all starts here. A new career. A new life. A new set of skills that changes everything.</p>
		<p>We combine classroom instruction from experienced software developers and UX designers with a responsive and supportive community to take your ideas from theory to reality.</p>
		<p>If you want to do more than learn to code—if you want to truly become a code and design professional—you need more than just a book. You need the advice and support of people who are currently working in the field. That’s what we’re here for. Let’s get to work.</p>
